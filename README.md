# Time-series-forecasting

Developed a time series forecasting model to predict future stock prices using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) methodology. The project involved preprocessing time-indexed data, performing stationarity checks using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, and tuning ARIMA model parameters for optimal forecasting.

Key steps included:

Imported and visualized historical stock price data using pandas and matplotlib.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.

Applied ADF test to evaluate data stationarity and performed differencing as needed.

Fitted the ARIMA model using statsmodels and selected appropriate (p, d, q) parameters.

Evaluated model performance through AIC/BIC values and residual analysis.

Forecasted future stock prices and visualized the predictions along with confidence intervals.

Outcome: Successfully demonstrated the capability to apply statistical time series modeling for real-world forecasting tasks. Gained practical experience in data handling, feature engineering, and time series analysis using Python.
